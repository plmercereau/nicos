  Whether to activate the initial linux-builder from the nixpkgs cache.

On the first run, the Linux builder needs to be created. Unless there is a corresponding nix builder set up,
the Darwin host won't be able to build the Linux builder with its custom configuraiton.

This option allows to disable the custom configuration of the linux-builder,
so that the Linux builder can be installed from the official cache.

Once the Linux builder is on, it is available as a build itself, and the option can then be disabled
so the host machine can rebuild it again with the custom configuration.
