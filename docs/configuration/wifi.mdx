## Rationale

- provision wifi SSIDs and passwords securely.
- build SD card images and live CDs with wifi credentials baked in.

## How it works

- encrypt wifi credentials in a secret
- expose a list of wifi networks
- add the networks to the machines with wireless enabled.
  - wifi credentials are only accessible to machines with wifi enabled

## How to enable it

- in the project
- in the machine's configuration

## Change the wifi networks

```bash
nix run github:plmercereau/nicos -- secrets wifi
```
